    <h1>Understanding Web Crawling</h1>
    <p>
        Web crawling is the process of automatically browsing the web to collect data from websites. 
        It's typically done by a program called a <strong>web crawler</strong> or <strong>spider</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Crawlers start with a list of URLs and then visit those pages, extracting links to follow 
        recursively. This is a key component of how search engines discover new content.
