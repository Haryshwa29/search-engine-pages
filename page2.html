    <h1>What is Indexing?</h1>
    <p>
        Indexing is the process of organizing and storing web content so it can be searched efficiently. 
        After a crawler collects data from web pages, the indexing system builds a searchable structure 
        out of that data.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most common structure is an <strong>inverted index</strong>, where each word maps to the 
        pages it appears in. This allows search engines to return results quickly when users type queries.
